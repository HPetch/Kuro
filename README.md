Kuro's Delivery Service game repo.

Hello there, this is Harry. I've been developing the main movement code for KDS for a little while, and for the most part it's complete and at a point where I can put it online so contributions can come in and help add parts to the game (e.g. the quests, the levels, the etc.)

If anything doesn't make sense, please let me know (Discord is LOLGuy213#7361 or https://discord.gg/h9AcXtp for the KDS development Discord server). I'll update here any documentation I need to do to clarify things.
